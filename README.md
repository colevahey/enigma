# Enigma

Enigma is a message encoder and decoder written using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Enigma takes an input from the user and returns an encoded message prefaced with a `#`. On any device, a user can input the encoded message and they will be returned with the original message. *Not so fast* you say. *Can't someone just crack the code, and your program is rendered useless?*. The Enigma program was created to be flexible and adaptable to change. If the `code` file is run, the letter assignments are randomly rearranged. While cracking the code over and over is a tedious task, altering the values only requires the running of a single file. This is why Enigma is so practical.
